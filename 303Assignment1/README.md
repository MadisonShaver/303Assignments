This program fills an array and lets the user search through or change and modify the array. 
The user has the option to search for an integer, change an integer, add an integer, or delete an integer.

The program starts by printing the array.
When prompted with this:

What would you like to do
s - search for integer in array
c - change an integer in array
a - add an integer to array
d - delete an integer from array
q - quit

the user should enter an option on the screen.

Using the search option, the user will need to enter an integer they want to search for.
This will output the index at which the integer was found.

Using the change option, the user will need to enter the index of the number they want to change and the number they would like to replace it with.
This will output the old number and the new number.

Using the add option, the user will need to enter the number they want to add.

Using the delete option, the user will need to enter the index of the number they would like to delete.
