This program will deal with a queue and a map.

First, the program will output a queue, and then output the same queue with the first element moved to the end of the queue.

Next, the program will output three statements based on whether or not the predetermined names are palindromes.

Next, the program will output a map of states and capitals, then output the same map with one of the capitals changed. 

Last, the user will be prompted with a statement to enter a state.
The user will need to enter any state (or word for that matter) and the program will output if it is found in the map, 
and if it is, what the capital is of that state.
