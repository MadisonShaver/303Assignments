This program allows a user (employee) to check their pay, vacation days, and health insurance allocation for a time period of their choosing. 

The program starts by asking if the user is a professional or unprofessional employee.
The employee should enter 1 for professional and 2 for unprofessional (this is shown in the program output).
The program is set up to give a warning message and repeat this section if the user did not enter 1 or 2.

When prompted with this:

Choose what you would like to do.

p - check how much money you have made

v - check how many vacation days you have

h - check how much money has gone into your health insurance

e - exit to the beginning

q - quit and leave the program

the user should enter one of the five options: p, v, h, e, q.

If the user chose to check how much money they've made (p), they will be prompted to and will need to enter the number of days they have worked 
if they are a professional employee, or the number of hours they have worked if they are an unprofessional employee. The amount of money they've
made will be outputted.

If the user chose to check how many vacation days they have (v), they will be prompted to and will need to enter the number of days
they have worked no matter if they are professional or unprofessional. The number of vacation days they have will be outputted.

of days they have worked if they are a professional employee, or the number of hours they've worked if they are an unprofessional employee.

or unprofessional employee.
